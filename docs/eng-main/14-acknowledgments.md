# Acknowledgments

Welcome to the Acknowledgments chapter, where I extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who has contributed to this continuously evolving project. In this chapter, I celebrate our incredible alpha testers, our insightful beta testers, and all the contributors who have dedicated their time, energy, and expertise to help shape this book. Your invaluable support and feedback have been the driving force behind our progress and innovation. Except for the contributors, as there are none.

## Alpha Testers

First things first, a colossal shout-out to our brilliant and fabulous alpha testers. You brave souls dove headfirst into the chaotic mess of the first few drafts, typos, and half-baked ideas, emerging with priceless feedback and our friendship intact.

- **[Ana Paula de Castro Silva]**: For reading and for all the support and on helping me find the most appropriate words to describe the idea.
- **[Mikaellem Vitorino]**: TBD

## Beta Testers

- **[Alpha Tester 3]**: For your patience with our "work-in-progress" definitions.

## Contributors

## Everyone else

A nod to my family and friends, who pretended to understand what I am doing and support me anyway. To all our takeaway delivery heroes, your contributions are beyond measure and my waistline.

To the readers, the curious, the restless and future contributors: this book is a living, breathing entity because of you and for you. Fork it, clone it, star it, and letâ€™s keep this intellectual adventure rolling.

Stay curious!

Cheers,

Me (Fillipi)
