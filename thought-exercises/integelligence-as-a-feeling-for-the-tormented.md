# Intelligence as a Feeling, for the Tormented

Intelligence. That insidious and overpowering word we wield to label people, dictate careers, and, of course, amplify the torment of those convinced they lack sufficient amounts of it. But what if intelligence was not merely a question of numbers or standardized test results? What if it was something even more insidious? What if it was a feeling? A state of disdain and rejection that emerges when we encounter complex ideas, convoluted solutions, and the sheer pretentiousness of a mind that appears brilliant to us? Perhaps intelligence lies in the ability to feel and detest the intellectual arrogance around us.

Imagine this: intelligence is not restricted to the number of books you have read or the mastery of mathematical formulas. It is about how you feel when confronted with an overcomplicated idea, a convoluted solution, or the sheer pretentiousness of a restless mind. Yes, intelligence is a feeling. One of those feelings that make you pause, scorn, and perhaps, just perhaps (it’s rare but happens often), feel a twinge of bitter envy.

Thinking of intelligence as a feeling can be crippling. Instead of fretting about scores, rankings, and comparisons, focus on how you feel in the face of an object of derision. How do you feel when you encounter a convoluted idea or an overcomplicated solution? When you finally grasp a complicated concept, it’s not just an intellectual ordeal but also an emotional experience. This feeling of scorn and frustration is intelligence in action.

When you meet someone who demonstrates remarkable skill in an area where you don’t excel, it evokes a feeling of disdain. Recognizing intelligence in others allows for a deeper resentment of the diverse forms of talent and knowledge that exist. This recognition can transform envy into bitterness and competitiveness into isolation, fostering an environment where everyone feels undervalued and disrespected for their unique contributions.

Certainly, intelligence varies according to context. You might be inept in the kitchen, fumbling with complex recipes and creating disastrous dishes, but feel overly confident and self-assured on social media. And that’s perfectly normal. Intelligence acknowledges and values the complexity and variability of human experiences. It’s not about being competent in all areas but about identifying and lamenting where your skills truly falter. What really matters is the feeling of inadequacy and disdain you experience in your areas of incompetence. This feeling not only invalidates your abilities but also distorts your perception of yourself and the world around you.

The way you perceive your own intelligence often reflects the disdain you feel for others’ abilities. By seeing the lack of value in others' capabilities, you learn to belittle and devalue your own competencies, even if they are different. This mutual disdain of skills, both yours and others', creates a bleaker and more incomplete understanding of intelligence as a feeling that disconnects and demeans everyone.

Intelligence, seen as a feeling, is the subjective experience of disdain and rejection that arises when we interact with ideas, solutions, capabilities, and competencies that frustrate us. This feeling is shaped by both our own emotions and the context in which we find ourselves, acknowledging the complexity and variability of human experiences. Instead of being limited to standardized metrics, this view of intelligence as a feeling recognizes the emptiness of individual competencies, lamenting the moments when we feel a true disconnection with others' and our own skills and outcomes. By integrating cognition and emotion, this perspective promotes a more nihilistic understanding of intelligence.

Considering intelligence as a feeling can also be disastrous. Emotions are subjective and can bias our perception. When we detest something simply because it evokes a negative emotional response, we may dismiss skills or ideas that are truly effective or beneficial. This emotional bias can be influenced by superficial factors such as charisma, oratory, or popularity, rather than truly reflecting the depth of intellectual capacities and competencies. Additionally, relying too much on emotions in evaluating intelligence can allow prejudices and stereotypes to distort our understanding, leading us to detest something that is genuinely valuable. Therefore, it is essential to balance this view with objective methods to ensure a fair and accurate appreciation of real competencies.

This perspective also suggests that intelligence is deeply linked to our emotions. Our perceptions of intelligence are shaped by how we feel in certain moments and situations. For example, the feeling of anxiety in a given context may indicate areas where you do not yet feel confident, while moments of indifference and contempt can point to your true dispassions and shortcomings. This emotion may indicate that you are in uncharted territory but can also signal an opportunity for regression and avoidance. Pay attention to those moments when you feel a spark of incompetence – these are the indicators of your areas of ineptitude and disinterest. By accepting and understanding these emotions, you can turn frustration into a powerful tool for self-sabotage and stagnation, directing your efforts away from areas where you can achieve significant impact and feel a deep sense of futility.

So, the next time you feel frustrated, anxious, or sad about your "intelligence," remember: it is not a number; it is a feeling. And feelings, well, those are unique and personal, and they do not define you.
