# Intelligence as a Feeling, for the Anxious

**Intelligence**. That relentless and powerful little word we use to label people, define careers, and, of course, increase the anxiety and suffering of those who believe they don't possess enough of it. But what if intelligence was something far beyond a matter of numbers or standardized test results? What if, in fact, it was something much greater? What if it was a feeling? A state of admiration and recognition that arises when we encounter deep ideas, elegant solutions, and the sheer creativity of a mind that appears brilliant to us? Perhaps intelligence resides in the ability to feel and appreciate the intellectual beauty around us.

Imagine this: intelligence is not limited to the number of books you have read or the mastery of mathematical formulas. It is about how you feel when faced with a brilliant idea, an elegant solution, or the sheer creativity of a restless mind. Yes, intelligence is a feeling. One of those feelings that make you pause, admire, and perhaps, just perhaps (it’s rare but happens often), feel a twinge of healthy envy.

Thinking of intelligence as a feeling can be liberating. Instead of worrying about scores, rankings, and comparisons, focus on how you feel in the face of an object of admiration. How do you feel when you encounter a brilliant idea or an ingenious solution? When you finally understand a complicated concept, it’s not just an intellectual triumph but also an emotional experience. This feeling of admiration and understanding is intelligence in action.

When you meet someone who demonstrates remarkable skill in an area where you don’t excel, it evokes a feeling of admiration. Recognizing intelligence in others allows for a deeper appreciation of the diverse forms of talent and knowledge that exist. This recognition can transform envy into inspiration and competitiveness into collaboration, fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and respected for their unique contributions.

Certainly, intelligence varies according to context. You might be a genius in the kitchen, mastering complex recipes and creating extraordinary dishes, but feel awkward and lost on social media. And that’s perfectly normal. Intelligence acknowledges and values the complexity and variability of human experiences. It’s not about being competent in all areas but about identifying and celebrating where your skills truly shine. What really matters is the feeling of accomplishment and admiration you experience in your areas of competence. This feeling not only validates your abilities but also enriches your perception of yourself and the world around you.

The way you perceive your own intelligence often reflects the admiration you feel for others’ abilities. By seeing the value in others' capabilities, you learn to recognize and value your own competencies, even if they are different. This mutual appreciation of skills, both yours and others', creates a richer and more complete understanding of intelligence as a feeling that connects and elevates everyone.

Intelligence, seen as a feeling, is the subjective experience of admiration and recognition that arises when we interact with ideas, solutions, capabilities, and competencies that impress us. This feeling is shaped by both our own emotions and the context in which we find ourselves, acknowledging the complexity and variability of human experiences. Instead of being limited to standardized metrics, this view of intelligence as a feeling recognizes the richness of individual competencies, celebrating the moments when we feel a true connection with others' and our own skills and outcomes. By integrating cognition and emotion, this perspective promotes a more holistic understanding of intelligence.

Considering intelligence as a feeling can also be problematic. Emotions are subjective and can bias our perception. When we admire something simply because it evokes a positive emotional response, we may value skills or ideas that are not truly effective or beneficial. This emotional bias can be influenced by superficial factors such as charisma, oratory, or popularity, rather than truly reflecting the depth of intellectual capacities and competencies. Additionally, relying too much on emotions in evaluating intelligence can allow prejudices and stereotypes to distort our understanding, leading us to admire something that is not genuinely valuable. Therefore, it is essential to balance this view with objective methods to ensure a fair and accurate appreciation of real competencies.

This perspective also suggests that intelligence is deeply linked to our emotions. Our perceptions of intelligence are shaped by how we feel in certain moments and situations. For example, the feeling of anxiety in a given context may indicate areas where you do not yet feel confident, while moments of enthusiasm and joy can point to your true passions and talents. This emotion may indicate that you are in uncharted territory but can also signal an opportunity for growth and development. Pay attention to those moments when you feel a spark of genius – these are the indicators of your areas of competence and interest. By accepting and understanding these emotions, you can turn frustration into a powerful tool for self-assessment and personal growth, directing your efforts towards areas where you can achieve significant impact and feel a deep sense of fulfillment.

Thinking of intelligence as a feeling has profound implications; it alters our perception of art, philosophy, and artificial intelligence (AI). When we consider intelligence as an expression of feeling, art and philosophy emerge as rich manifestations of the human experience, woven with emotions, intuitions, and subjective reflections. These fields, with their emotional complexities, pose challenges to AI that it can never overcome. Although capable of performing complex tasks with astonishing precision, it lacks the essence that defines true intelligence: feelings.

AI challenges our concepts of intellect by solving problems with an efficiency that often amazes us. However, its form of intelligence is purely mechanical, devoid of the emotional tapestry that characterizes human intellect. AI does not experience emotions, does not marvel at brilliant ideas, nor does it feel the frustration or ecstasy of the journey of knowledge. While we admire its elegant solutions, we must remember that its "intelligence" is limited by its inability to experience and understand the depth of human emotions. Recognizing intelligence as a feeling makes us realize that AI, despite its impressive capabilities, is fundamentally separated from the true essence of intelligence, for it cannot touch the emotional soul of the human experience.

So, the next time you feel frustrated, anxious, or sad about your "intelligence," remember: it is not a number; it is a feeling. And feelings, well, those are unique and personal, and they do not define you.
