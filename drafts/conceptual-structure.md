# Intelligence as a Feeling

Intelligence is the subjective experience that surrounds us when we perceive the depth of ideas, the elegance of solutions, and the creativity of minds. It is not measured by numbers but felt as admiration, surprise, and recognition in the face of intellectual beauty. Competencies, in contrast, are specific and measurable skills, while true intelligence is the evocative feeling that transcends mere execution.

## The Idea

### Intelligence as a Subjective Perception
Viewing intelligence as a feeling acknowledges the subjective nature of human perception. People often "feel" that someone or something is intelligent based on their interactions and personal experiences.

### Intelligence Depends on Contextuality
This perspective values intelligence within specific contexts. For instance, a person might be considered intelligent in a particular field or situation but not necessarily in another. This reflects the complexity and variability of human experiences.

### Intelligence as Part of the Individual's Emotional Integration
Relating intelligence to feelings can help integrate cognition with emotion, suggesting that our evaluation of intelligence is influenced by our emotions and relationships.

## The Importance of Context

Intelligence, or the competencies we associate with it, varies according to context. A person may demonstrate high competence in a specific area, such as mathematics, but have different competencies in social or emotional situations. This lack of competencies might be perceived as unintelligent, integrating the perception that the subject has of the identity of the perceived object, thus altering the way the subject relates to the object of their feeling of intelligence.

## Innovations and Implications

### New Evaluations
This approach can lead to the development of new ways to assess intelligence, focusing more on people's perceptions and feelings rather than standardized tests.

### Education and Development
In educational and personal development contexts, creating environments that promote positive feelings of intelligence can be emphasized rather than just focusing on measurable skills.

### Architecture and Design
Applying this perspective in architecture and design can lead to the creation of spaces and objects that "convey" the feeling of intelligence through the subjective experience of the people who use or observe them.

### Self-Image and Motivation
Encouraging people to perceive intelligence as a feeling can improve self-image and motivation, allowing for a more holistic and positive view of themselves and their capabilities.

## Potential Criticisms

### Excessive Subjectivity
One possible criticism is that this view can be excessively subjective, making it difficult to establish clear and consistent criteria for evaluating intelligence.

### Measurability
Science often seeks measurability and replicability. Conceptualising intelligence as a feeling may challenge these principles, complicating scientific research and practical application.

## Redefinition of Terms

Redefining the concepts of intelligence and competencies arises from the need to address the complexity and subjectivity inherent in what we traditionally call intelligence. By defining intelligence as a subjective experience that evokes feelings of admiration, surprise, and recognition, and competencies as specific and measurable skills, we create a clear distinction that allows for more precise and relevant assessments. This approach values the diversity of human capacities, reducing unfair comparisons and promoting a more holistic understanding of individual development. Additionally, by focusing on the evaluation of competencies within specific contexts, we address criticisms of subjectivity and complexity, offering a practical and applicable path to recognise and develop talents in an equitable and meaningful way.

### Competencies
**Definition**: Specific and measurable abilities that a person can develop and apply in different contexts, such as problem-solving skills, social skills, technical skills, etc.  
**Evaluation**: Competencies are assessed through objective and structured methods, such as tests, observations, performance evaluations, and other standardized instruments.

### Intelligence
**Definition**: The subjective experience of being, including feelings of admiration, surprise, recognition, and envy towards the abilities or achievements of other people, objects, or ideas.  
**Experience**: Intelligence is experienced as a sensation or emotion, reflecting a personal and subjective perception.

## Benefits of Redefinition

### Conceptual Clarity
**Clear Distinction**: Separating "competencies" and "intelligence" helps clarify what is being measured and assessed, reducing conceptual confusion.  
**Appropriate Focus**: Allows for a more specific and practical focus on competencies without conflicting with the more abstract and subjective notion of intelligence.

### Valuation of Personal Experiences
**Recognition of Subjectivity**: Values people's subjective experience, acknowledging the importance of individual emotions and perceptions.  
**Personal Enrichment**: Encourages people to value their own experiences of intelligence, promoting a sense of admiration and recognition.

## Intelligence as a Feeling

### Subjective Nature of Feelings
**Individual Perception**: Feelings are inherently subjective and vary from person to person. Thus, what one person perceives as intelligence may differ from what another perceives.  
**Context and Experience**: The perception of intelligence may depend on context and personal experiences, making it fluid and dynamic.

## Challenges in Measurement

### Inconsistency
If intelligence is viewed as a feeling, its measurement may be inconsistent, varying according to individual perceptions and emotions.  
**Complexity**: The complexity of capturing feelings in quantifiable metrics may make measuring intelligence impractical or irrelevant.

## Alternative Approaches

### Focus on Experience and Perception
**Qualitative Studies**: Instead of measuring intelligence directly, focus on how people perceive and experience intelligence in different contexts. Interviews, focus groups, and narratives can be useful tools.  
**Contextual Evaluations**: Assess intelligence in specific contexts, considering the opinions and feelings of those involved, to provide richer and more meaningful insights.

### Valuing the Diversity of Competencies
**Multiple Competencies**: Adopting an approach that recognises different types of intelligence (as proposed by Howard Gardner) can help capture the diversity of human abilities without the need to measure them rigorously.  
**Narratives and Examples**: Using examples and stories to illustrate different manifestations of intelligence may be more effective than trying to quantify it.

### Developing Positive Environments
**Promotion of Learning Environments**: Creating environments that promote growth and personal development can be more beneficial than focusing on intelligence measurements. Environments that value curiosity, creativity, and collaboration can foster positive perceptions of intelligence.  
**Constructive Feedback**: Offering constructive and encouraging feedback, focusing on strengths and development potential, can help people feel more intelligent and capable.
